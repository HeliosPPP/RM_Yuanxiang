  abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is considerably impacted by security challenges, which has lately demanded substantial consideration. Accordingly, certain reviews and surveys have been presented, focusing on disparate IoT-related domains, including IoT security, intrusion detection systems, and emerging technologies. However, in this article, we solely target IoT security with respect to product lifecycle stages. In that regard, we provide a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art surveys in an initial phase which concentrate on distinct parameters required for IoT security. Further, we present prominent solutions for addressing product lifecycle security in IoT. In this context, the contributions of this article are: (a) IoT product lifecycle security, (b) security taxonomy in IoT product lifecycle, (c) security solutions for each lifecycle phase in product lifecycle stages, and (d) open issues in these lifecycle stages that pose new research challenges. Consequently, the advancing research related to IoT security, especially with respect to product lifecycle, is explored through state-of-the-art developments in the domain of product lifecycle security.}

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) concepts are now being broadly investigated for actual deployment initiatives. Although ecosystem-wide architectures and standards are still slowly evolving and/or still lacking, some progress is being made; standardization fosters flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and ubiquitous deployment. Applications range from infrastructure and critical-infrastructure support (for example smart grid, smart city, smart building, and transportation), to end-user applications such as e-health, crowdsensing, and further along, to a multitude of other applications where only the imagination is the limit. This article discusses a specific example of an IoT application supporting Smart Campuses. Smart Campuses are part of a continuum that spans cities at the large-scale end to smart buildings at the small-scale end, and encompass universities, business parks, hospitals, housing developments, correctional facilities, and other real estate environments. The specific Use Case example covered in this article relates to an actual project to automate some key functions at a set of large campuses, but the nature of the campus is not directly revealed. After a review of the applicable IoT and control technologies, this Best Practices article describes technological solutions that were employed to support the requisite control functions and serves as an example for the applicability of IoT to Smart Campus applications.},

abstract = {Smart City policies have attracted relevant attention and funding over the last few years. While the time seems now ripe to conclude that such policies have a positive impact on urban economic growth, the picture is much less clear when looking at the microfoundations of this effect. In this paper we look at the urban innovation impact of Smart City policies. In fact, typical Smart City projects imply the involvement not only of major multinational corporations, along with local public authorities, but also of local companies, typically with the aim to translate general technological solutions to the local needs. A new data set collected for these analyses comprises data on Smart City features for 309 European metropolitan areas, Smart City policy intensity, and urban innovation outputs. The latter are proxied by calculating total patent applications to the European Patent Office between 2008 and 2013. Patent counts also include technologically narrower classes, namely high-tech, ICT, and specific Smart City technologies patent applications. Propensity Score Matching estimates suggest that cities engaging in Smart City policies above the EU average also tend to patent more intensively. This effect is stronger for high-tech patents, while decreases for more narrowly defined technological classes. This last result suggests possible technological spillovers from technologies directly involved in Smart City policies.}

abstract={Both 5G cellular and IoT technologies are expected to see widespread deployment in the next few years. At the practical level, 5G will see initial deployments in urban areas. This is perhaps fortuitous from an IoT perspective, since many “mainstream” applications of IoT will support Smart Cities, Smart Campuses and Smart Buildings. Bandwidth demand for a number of Smart City applications is the main driver for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)-based 5G services in general, and new-generation 5G IoT applications, in particular. In turn, the use of the millimeter wave spectrum is required to enable 5G cellular technologies to support high data rates. Millimeter wave solutions, however, impose a requirement for small cells. Generally, an implementer tries to use one or a small handful of IoT technologies; preferably, and for managerial simplicity, the implementer would want to use a cellular/5G IoT technology for all nodes, whether indoors or outdoors, instead of a heterogenous mix of various IoT technologies that have evolved over the years. This overview paper discusses a number of practical issues related to 5G-based IoT applications, particularly in Smart City environments, including the need for small cells, the transmission issues at millimeter wave frequencies, building penetration issues, the need for Distributed Antenna Systems, and the near term introduction of pre-5G IoT technologies such as NB-IoT and LTE-M, these being possible proxies for the commercial deployment and acceptance of 5G IoT.},

abstract = {Abstract Federated Learning (FL) is a framework where multiple parties can train a model jointly without sharing private data. Private information protection is a critical problem in FL. However, the communication overheads of existing solutions are too heavy for IoT devices in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, they cannot ensure robustness when IoT devices become offline. In this paper, Democratic Federated Learning (DemoFL) is proposed, which is a privacy-preserving FL framework that has sufficiently low communication overheads. DemoFL involves a consensus module to ensure the system is robust. It also utilizes a tree structure to reduce the time communication overheads and realizes high robustness without reducing accuracy. The proposed algorithm reduces the communication complexity of aggregation at training by M \$M\$ times, M \$M\$ being a controllable parameter. Sufficient experiments have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results also demonstrate the practicality of the proposed framework for IoT devices in unstable environments.},
